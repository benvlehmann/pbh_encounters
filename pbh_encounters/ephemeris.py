Module: ephemeris.py

This module provides classes and functionality for creating and managing
ephemerides of celestial bodies within solar system simulations. It includes
classes for defining bodies, both standard and primordial black holes
(PBHs), and groups of bodies. Additionally, it offers utilities for fetching
ephemeris data from NASA's JPL Horizons system and calculating distances
between celestial objects.

Classes:
- Ephemeris: Represents the ephemeris of a celestial body, storing position
  and velocity data. It provides functionality to calculate distances to
  other objects and manage time-ordered ephemeris data.

- Body: A data class representing a celestial body with attributes like ID,
  name, mass, and ephemeris. It includes methods to fetch ephemeris data from
  JPL Horizons, calculate distances to other bodies, and update its
  ephemeris.

- PbhBody: A subclass of Body, specifically representing a primordial black
  hole. It overrides certain functionalities of the Body class to cater to
  the unique nature of PBHs.

- BodyGroup: Manages groups of bodies, allowing for collective operations such
  as updating ephemerides, generating observing times, and handling
  collections of bodies.

The module is structured to support a variety of solar system simulation
scenarios, including the incorporation of primordial black holes and the
study of their potential effects on other celestial bodies. It integrates
closely with the functionality provided in the `jpl.py` module for retrieving
necessary ephemeris data.

Example Usage:
>>> from ephemeris import Body, PbhBody, BodyGroup
>>> mars = Body.fetch(499)
>>> pbh = PbhBody(mass=1e-5)
>>> bodies = BodyGroup(mars, pbh)
>>> print(bodies)

Dependencies:
- numpy: Used for numerical operations and handling arrays.

    ephemeris data and to handle the ephemeris data efficiently.

    Parameters:
    *args: Variable length argument list, not currently used in this class.
    **kwargs: Keyword arguments that should include the ephemeris data keys:
        - t (array): Array of time points.

            position.

            which can be supplied in place of the other keywords.

    Attributes: data (numpy.ndarray): A 2D array of shape (n, 7) where 'n' is
    the number of time points. This array contains concatenated time,

    subset of 'data' containing only the position coordinates (x, y, z).
    vxyz (numpy.ndarray): A subset of 'data' containing only the velocity
    components (vx, vy, vz).
